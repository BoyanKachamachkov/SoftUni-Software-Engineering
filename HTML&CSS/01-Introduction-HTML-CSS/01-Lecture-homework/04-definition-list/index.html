        <dt>Corki:</dt>
        <dd>he yordle pilot Corki loves two things above all others: flying, and his glamorous mustache… though not
            necessarily in that order. After leaving Bandle City, he settled in Piltover and fell in love with the
            wondrous machines he found there. He dedicated himself to the development of flying contraptions, leading an
            aerial defense force of seasoned veterans known as the Screaming Yipsnakes. Calm under fire, Corki patrols
            the skies around his adopted home, and has never encountered a problem that a good missile barrage couldn’t
            solve.</dd>


        <dt>Vladimir:</dt>
        <dd>A fiend with a thirst for mortal blood, Vladimir has influenced the affairs of Noxus since the empire’s
            earliest days. In addition to unnaturally extending his life, his mastery of hemomancy allows him to control
            the minds and bodies of others as easily as his own. In the flamboyant salons of the Noxian aristocracy,
            this has enabled him to build a fanatical cult of personality around himself—while in the lowest back
            alleys, it allows him to bleed his enemies dry.</dd>

        <dt>Katarina:</dt>
        <dd>Decisive in judgment and lethal in combat, Katarina is a Noxian assassin of the highest caliber. Eldest
            daughter to the legendary General Du Couteau, she made her talents known with swift kills against
            unsuspecting enemies. Her fiery ambition has driven her to pursue heavily-guarded targets, even at the risk
            of endangering her allies—but no matter the mission, Katarina will not hesitate to execute her duty amid a
            whirlwind of serrated daggers.

/* 
An HTML page holds a list of towns, a search box, and a [Search] button. Implement the search function to bold and underline the items from the list which include the text from the search box. Also, print the number of items the current search matches in the format `${matches} matches found`.
Note: It is necessary to clear the results of the previous search.
Write your JavaScript code in this file:
 */

function search() {
	/* 
	1.	Target the input field with a variable
	2.	Target the result ID for the end output

	3.	Extract all list elements's text
			queryAll + li
			transfer to arr

	4.	Iterate through all items
			-transfer to TEXT CONTENT of the item
			-use counter 
			includes searched text?
				true?
				-underline (style.fontWeight) + style.textDecoration

				false?
				-reset styles to prepare for new search
